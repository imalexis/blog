Customized rendering refers to the ability to create and control the appearance and behavior of components in a way that goes beyond the default or standard rendering provided by a library or framework.
Customized rendering is a powerful concept that allows you to tailor your application to specific needs and design considerations.

## 1. Component Structure and Style

We can customize the structure and style of our components to align with your application's design. 
This involves writing custom HTML, CSS, or JSX to define how the component should look.

## 2. Dynamic Content and Data Binding
Customized rendering allow us to handle dynamic content data binding. 
We can create components that accept dynamic data as props and render it accordingly.
This can involve conditional rendering, iterating over data arrays, or using other techniques to dynamically display content

## 3. Event Handling
Customize the how the components respond ti user interactions by handling events. 
This includes defining custom event handler and specifing how the component should behave when certain actions occur.

## 4. Conditional Rendering
Customize the rendering of components based on certain conditions. 
E.g., show or hide specific elements, change styles, or render alternaive content based on the state or props of a component.
