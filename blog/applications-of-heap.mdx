<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="The Top K Problem" label="The Top K Problem" default>
        Use the Heap data structure to obtain Top Kâ€™s largest or smallest elements.

        Solution of the Top K largest elements:
        1. Construct a Max Heap.
        2. Add all elements into the Max Heap.
        3. Traversing and deleting the top element, and store the value into the result arry T.
        4. Repeat step 3 until we have removed the K largest elements.

        Solution of the Top K smalllest elements
        1. Construct a Min Heap
        2. Add all elements into the Min Heap
        3. Traversing and deleing the top element, and store the value into the result array T.
        4. Repeat step 3 until we have removed the K smallest elements.

        Time Complexity: O(KlogN + N)
        Space complexity: O(N)
