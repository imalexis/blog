 general steps for creating a new object using Relay Mutations:

 <!-- truncate -->

### 1. Define a GraphQL Mutation
   Create a GraphQL mutation that represents the action of creating a new object. This mutation should include input fields representing the data needed to create the object.

```js
   // Example GraphQL mutation

const mutation = graphql`
    mutation ObjectMutation($input: CreateObjectInput!) {
    createObject(input: $input) {
    object {
      id
      name
      // other fields
    }
  }
}
` 
```

### 2. Create a Relay Mutation
creare the commit method
```js
const [commit] = useMutation<CreateObjectMutation>(mutation);
```
CreateObjectMutation: the type of mutation 

mutation: the definition of mutation 
<br/>
### 3. invoke commit
the new object to be create should be place in the "input" property of "variable". "variable" is a property of the big Object we commit.

```js
<Button
        type="primary"
        onClick={() =>
          commit({
            variables: { input: { createdBy: 1, name: title } },
            onCompleted: (response, errors) => {
              navigate("/admin/forms");
            },
          })
        }
/>
```

:::tip

When developing a React app with Relay, you often use the babel-plugin-relay/macro package to enable the graphql template literal tag for your GraphQL queries. This allows you to embed GraphQL queries directly into your JavaScript or TypeScript files.

In Relay applications, when using the babel-plugin-relay/macro, you import the graphql template tag from the babel-plugin-relay/macro package instead of the generic graphql package. This is because the graphql template tag provided by babel-plugin-relay/macro is a special version tailored for Relay's use and is capable of performing ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation.

When you use `import { graphql } from "babel-plugin-relay/macro";`, the Babel plugin processes the GraphQL queries at build time, generating optimized artifacts that are used by Relay to make more efficient GraphQL requests.

By using the babel-plugin-relay/macro, you get the benefits of AOT compilation, which includes:

Faster Runtime: The Relay compiler processes the queries at build time, so the runtime environment doesn't need to perform complex parsing and transformations on GraphQL queries.

Smaller Bundle Sizes: AOT compilation allows the Relay compiler to generate optimized artifacts, resulting in smaller bundle sizes for your application.

Static Validation: Queries are statically validated during the build process, catching errors early in development rather than at runtime.

Using the generic graphql package wouldn't provide these benefits, as it doesn't have the Relay-specific optimizations implemented by the babel-plugin-relay/macro. Therefore, when working with Relay, it's recommended to import graphql from babel-plugin-relay/macro for an improved development and runtime experience.
