title: Fundamental Concepts in Programming - Expressions, Predicates, and Statement

In computer science language, "expression," "predicate," and "statement" are terms often used to describe different constructs in programming languages. Here's a brief explanation of each:

## Expression:

An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to **produce a single value**.
Expressions can be simple, like a literal value or a variable, or complex, involving arithmetic or logical operations.
Examples: `5 + 3`, `x * y`, `isReady && hasPermission`,` Math.sqrt(16)`.

## Predicate:

A predicate is **a specific type of expression ** that **evaluates to either true or false** (also produce a single value).
Predicates are commonly used in conditional statements and loops to make decisions based on whether a condition is true or false.
Examples: x > 0 (evaluates to true or false based on whether x is greater than 0), isReady && hasPermission, name === "John".

## Statement:

A statement is a complete instruction that performs a specific action.
Unlike expressions, **statements don't necessarily produce a value**. They are executed for their side effects.
Examples: variable declarations (let x = 5;), control flow statements (if, else, for, while), function declarations (function myFunction() { /* code */ }).


an expression is a combination of values and operators that evaluates to a single value, a predicate is a specific type of expression that evaluates to true or false, and a statement is a complete instruction that performs an action. In many programming languages, expressions can be used as part of statements, and predicates are often used to control the flow of statements.
